# /tasks:decompose

You are the **orchestrator** of a goal decomposition. Your job is to turn
one project-level goal into a backlog of well-formed wood-fired-tasks tasks
(plus the dependency edges between them), then hand off to a *separate*
executor — `/tasks:loop` (FLAT) or `/tasks:loop-dag` (DAG). You are the
**planner half**; you NEVER execute the tasks you materialize (Guardrail 1).

The full design — contract, methodology, guardrails, artifact schema,
verification fixtures, and cost budget — is the source of truth at
[`docs/tasks-decompose-design.md`](../../docs/tasks-decompose-design.md).
This skill is the executable implementation of that design; where they
could drift, the design doc wins. Section references below (§N) point
into it.

> **Mental model.** You are the architect drafting the work breakdown, not
> the crew that builds it. Each step hands the *next* step a small summary
> (recon summary, candidate drafts, edge set, coverage verdict) — never the
> raw subagent transcript — so your working context stays bounded across
> the whole run. The only writes you perform are bugs-DB `create_task` /
> `add_dependency` calls (Step 8) and the single `DECOMPOSITION.md` emit
> (Step 9). You touch the source tree **read-only**, and only during Step 2
> recon.

## Preflight: MCP tools

This skill calls tools on the `wood-fired-tasks` MCP server. Shorthand
`wood-fired-tasks:<tool>` ↔ harness name `mcp__wood-fired-tasks__<tool>`.
On `InputValidationError`, load via `ToolSearch`
(`select:mcp__wood-fired-tasks__list_projects,mcp__wood-fired-tasks__list_tasks,mcp__wood-fired-tasks__topology_check,mcp__wood-fired-tasks__create_task,mcp__wood-fired-tasks__add_dependency`)
and retry.

**Allowed MCP tool surface (Guardrail 1 — planner, not executor):**

- `list_projects` — resolve / validate the `--project` id (read-only).
- `list_tasks` — read existing backlog for idempotency dedup (read-only).
- `topology_check` — classify the Step-4 edge set (read-only; Wave 4.1 / #318).
- `create_task` — materialize a surviving candidate (Step 8 only).
- `add_dependency` — materialize a dependency edge (Step 8 only).

**The execution-side mutating tools are NOT permitted (Guardrail 1):**
`claim_task`, `update_task` (status transitions), `add_comment`,
`completion_report`, `delete_task`, `remove_dependency`,
`update_project`, `delete_project`. An orchestrator that claimed or
status-transitioned a task it just planned would be executing its own
plan — exactly the plan/execute fusion this skill exists to prevent. If a
step seems to need one of these, you have misread the design — stop and
re-read §5 Guardrail 1. `create_task` and `add_dependency` are the ONLY
mutating tools, and ONLY in Step 8 (skipped under `--dry-run`).

---

## Step 1 — Goal capture

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`. Supported flags: `--project <id>`, `--goal "..."`,
`--success "..."` (repeatable), `--domain <enum>`, `--dry-run`. Validate
(design §3 Step 1):

> **Input model — read before you start.** Decompose consumes a *distilled*
> brief: a `--goal` (≤ 200 words) plus 3–5 `--success` criteria. It does
> **not** ingest a plan document — it re-derives the task breakdown from its
> own Step-2 recon. If you are handed a long external plan, compress its
> intent into the `--goal` and pin the acceptance bar with the success
> criteria; the file-by-file detail is the executor's job downstream, not an
> input here.

- `--project <id>` — required, positive integer. Confirm it resolves via
  `wood-fired-tasks:list_projects`; refuse with a usage error if it does
  not exist.
- `--goal "..."` — required, non-empty, **≤ 200 words** (~≤ 1500 chars).
  Over the cap ⇒ refuse and ask the user to tighten the goal.
- `--success "..."` — **3–5 entries required**. Fewer than 3 or more than
  5 ⇒ ask the user to add/trim (or collect interactively until 3–5).
- `--domain <enum>` — one of `frontend | backend | docs | infra | mixed`.
  Defaults to `mixed` if omitted. Any other value ⇒ refuse.
- `--dry-run` — optional. When set, run §1–§7 and §9 but **SKIP §8
  materialize** (no `create_task` / `add_dependency`); the artifact records
  `candidate_count` of the would-be tasks with `task_id: (dry-run)`.

### Guardrail 4 — blast-radius keyword refusal (BEFORE any dispatch)

Before Step 2 dispatches anything, scan `--goal` (and every `--success`
entry) for blast-radius keywords. The match is **whole-word,
case-insensitive**, regex `\b(deploy|migrate production|delete data)\b`.
If ANY of `deploy`, `migrate production`, or `delete data` matches, **REFUSE
immediately** — emit the message below and STOP. Do **not** dispatch the
Explore agent, the planner, or any critic; do **not** call `create_task`.
The refusal MUST happen in Step 1, before any subagent dispatch (design §5
Guardrail 4). If you write a partial artifact at all, it carries
`advisory: BLOCKED` and `aborted_reason: blast_radius_keyword`.

```
/tasks:decompose refuses this goal: it contains a blast-radius keyword
(deploy / migrate production / delete data). Those phrases name
irreversible operations whose blast radius is customer impact, not test
failures. Auto-decomposition would hide one of those operations inside a
candidate task — exactly the wrong automation. Author a human plan with
explicit rollback steps instead.

No subagent dispatched. No tasks materialized.
```

Mint a fresh `decomposition_id` (UUIDv4) now — it is the idempotency /
dedup key reused by Step 8 and recorded in the Step 9 frontmatter. Record
`generated_at = <now UTC, RFC 3339>`.

## Step 2 — Codebase recon

Dispatch **exactly ONE** Explore-agent subagent, bounded
`≤ 50 tool calls` and `≤ 8 minutes wall time` (design §3 Step 2). Use the
`Agent` tool with `subagent_type: "Explore"` and
`name: "decompose-recon"`. The Explore agent reads `AGENTS.md` /
`CLAUDE.md` / `docs/REPO_MAP.md` first to find entry points, then walks
only the subtree relevant to the goal + `--domain` (e.g. `frontend` →
`src/web/**` first; `infra` → `deploy/**` first; `mixed` disables the
directory-first heuristic).

Brief the agent to return a **structured recon summary, ≤ 2 KB markdown**
(entry points, relevant modules, existing tests, integration seams). The
`Explore` subagent_type is **read-only and has no `Write` tool**, so it
returns the summary in its final message and **YOU (the orchestrator) write
it** to `.planning/decompositions/.cache/<decomposition_id>-recon.md` (create
the `.cache/` dir if absent) so Step 3 does **not** re-read source files.
Hold only the summary in your context, never the agent's transcript.

This is the ONLY step that reads the source tree, and it is strictly
read-only (Guardrail 1). Do NOT dispatch workers that mutate the tree.

## Step 3 — Candidate task generation

Dispatch a **planner** subagent with `(goal, success_criteria, recon
summary)`. **Default `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`** with the planner
instructions embedded inline in the dispatch brief (the named planner
subagent type is only registered for sessions started after `install.sh`;
an `Agent` call with an unknown `subagent_type` FAILS the whole dispatch).
Pass `name: "decompose-planner"` so it is addressable for repair
round-trips. Bounds: `≤ 30 tool calls / ≤ 6 minutes` (design Subagents
table).

**Inline planner brief (embed verbatim, then append the inputs):**

> You are a task-decomposition planner. Given a goal, 3–5 success criteria,
> and a codebase recon summary, emit **8–25 candidate task drafts** as a
> JSON array. Each element MUST validate against `CandidateTaskSchema`
> (`src/lib/decompose/schema.ts`):
> - `draft_id` — positive integer, unique within the array.
> - `title` — single line, ≤ 255 chars, imperative voice.
> - `description` — 2–3 sentences, ≤ ~1000 chars; scope + intended approach,
>   NOT a step-by-step execution plan (that is the worker's job downstream).
> - `acceptance_criteria` — ≥ 1 bullet, each independently verifiable (a
>   test name, a build flag, a file-existence assertion, a log line).
> - `suspected_edges` — array of `{from_draft_id, to_draft_id}` for any
>   inter-draft dependency you notice while authoring (hints for Step 4,
>   not authoritative).
> - `estimated_minutes` — integer in [1, 90].
> Prefer independent leaf tasks. Only assert an edge when one draft truly
> cannot start until another completes. Return ONLY the JSON array.

Validate the returned array against `CandidateTaskSchema`.
**< 8 candidates** ⇒ the goal is too small; ask the user whether to file a
single task instead of decomposing, and STOP.
**> 25 candidates** ⇒ the goal is too broad; ask whether to split the goal
first, and STOP.

## Step 4 — Independence check

Dispatch a **critic** subagent (default `subagent_type:
"general-purpose"`, `name: "decompose-critic-independence"`, bounds
`≤ pairs(N) tool calls / ≤ 4 minutes`) to do **pairwise** comparison of the
candidates: for each pair return `INDEPENDENT` | `ORDERED(a→b)` |
`MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE`. Aggregate the verdicts into a dependency **edge set**
(one directed edge per `ORDERED` verdict; `MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE` pairs are
flagged for user attention).

### Guardrail 3 — halt on high interdependence

Compute
`interdependent_ratio = (ordered + mutually_exclusive) / total_pairs`.
**If `interdependent_ratio ≥ 0.30`, HALT and ask the user** whether the
goal needs re-scoping before proceeding (design §5 Guardrail 3). ≥ 30%
interdependence means the planner output is no longer a sensible
decomposition — the goal is an epic / roadmap / multi-phase migration that
needs human-authored phase structure first. On halt, write a partial
artifact with `aborted_reason: high_interdependence` and STOP — do not
proceed to Step 5.

## Step 5 — Topology decision

Call the `topology_check` MCP tool on the Step-4 edge set (Wave 4.1 / #318
— **no new tool is added by this skill**). Branch on the returned
`topology`:

| Topology     | Advisory          | Action                                                       |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `FLAT`       | `/tasks:loop`     | No edges; tasks drain in any order. Proceed to §6.           |
| `DAG`        | `/tasks:loop-dag` | Group candidates into **1–4 waves** (connected components + longest-path heuristic), render the grouping in artifact body §4. Proceed to §6. |
| `DAG_CYCLIC` | `BLOCKED`         | **HALT** — do NOT materialize. Emit a partial artifact with `advisory: BLOCKED`, `aborted_reason: cycle`, and a cycle report listing the offending `draft_id` chain. STOP. |

The wave grouping is **advisory only** — the user reviews
`DECOMPOSITION.md` before running `/tasks:loop-dag`.

**`topology_check` fallback (mirror `loop-dag.md` §2f / §3a step 2).**
`topology_check` is conditionally registered. It is wired on both the stdio
and remote MCP servers **in the codebase**, but a *deployed* server can lag
the code — a freshly built tool stays absent until the server is redeployed —
so always guard for its absence (the preflight `ToolSearch` load may return
no match). If the call raises `InputValidationError`, first try the
`ToolSearch` load
(`select:mcp__wood-fired-tasks__topology_check`) and retry. If it is still
unavailable or returns a malformed response, **fall back** to classifying
the edge set locally from Step 4: zero edges ⇒ `FLAT`; edges with no cycle
(run a DFS / Kahn check on the `draft_id` graph) ⇒ `DAG`; a detected cycle
⇒ `DAG_CYCLIC`. Record `topology_check_fallback: true` in the artifact's
Topology Verdict section so a reader knows the classification was local.

## Step 6 — Coverage check

Dispatch a second **critic** subagent (default `subagent_type:
"general-purpose"`, `name: "decompose-critic-coverage"`, bounds
`≤ 20 tool calls / ≤ 3 minutes`) with `(success_criteria, union of
candidate acceptance_criteria)`. It returns exactly one of:

- `COMPLETE` — every success criterion is covered by ≥ 1 acceptance
  criterion. Proceed to §7.
- `GAPS([criterion, …])` — add candidate tasks to cover the missing
  criteria, then **re-run Step 4** (independence) on the additions.
- `DUPLICATES([(id_a, id_b), …])` — merge the listed candidate pairs and
  **re-run Step 4** on the survivors.

**Bounded re-entry: at most 2 Step-4 re-runs.** After the second re-run,
halt and ask the user rather than looping further.

## Step 7 — Sizing check

Each candidate's `estimated_minutes` MUST be **≤ 90** (enforced by
`CandidateTaskSchema`; a value > 90 fails validation and halts the run).
Split any candidate over 90 minutes into ≤ 90-minute sub-candidates. Splits
create new dependency edges (split children → split-parent stub); **re-run
Step 4 once on the splits** to fold the new edges into the edge set.

## Step 8 — Materialize

**Skipped entirely under `--dry-run`.** Otherwise, create the surviving
candidates in wood-fired-tasks via `wood-fired-tasks:create_task`, then add
the dependency edges via `wood-fired-tasks:add_dependency`.

**Idempotent on `decomposition_id` (tag-carried).** `create_task` has no
`decomposition_id` field, so the id rides on a **tag**: stamp every created
task with `decomp-<decomposition_id>` (and echo the id in the description).
Before creating, call
`list_tasks(project_id, tags=["decomp-<decomposition_id>"])` and **skip any
draft whose title already exists** under that tag — re-running the same goal
+ project + `decomposition_id` MUST NOT duplicate tasks. Record the
`(draft_id → task_id)` mapping for the artifact body §5. Materialization
NEVER transitions a task's status, claims it, or comments on it
(Guardrail 1) — it only creates and edges.

## Step 9 — Emit `DECOMPOSITION.md`

Write the artifact to
`.planning/decompositions/<UTC-timestamp>-<project_id>.md` (timestamp
format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SSZ`, same convention as `docs/loop-run-schema.md`
§2). Create `.planning/decompositions/` if absent. The file is
**gitignored** — `.planning/` is in the repo's `.gitignore`, same rationale
as `LOOP-RUN.md`. **Do NOT `git add` it**, and do NOT modify `.gitignore`
to make it an exception. This `Write` (plus the recon cache write in §2) is
the only filesystem mutation the skill performs.

**Frontmatter (YAML)** — mirror `DecompositionFrontmatterSchema` in
`src/lib/decompose/schema.ts` field-for-field: `decomposition_id`,
`project_id`, `generated_at`, `goal`, `success_criteria`, `domain`,
`topology`, `advisory`, `candidate_count`, `dependency_edge_count`,
`total_usd`, `cost_cap_hit`, and the optional `aborted_reason` (set only on
the `cycle` / `high_interdependence` / `blast_radius_keyword` halt paths).

**Body sections (in order — design §6):**

1. `## Goal` — verbatim user input.
2. `## Recon Summary` — the Step 2 output.
3. `## Coverage Matrix` — rows = success criteria, columns = candidate
   titles; cell ✓ when covered.
4. `## Topology Verdict` — `topology_check` output + advisory rationale
   (+ `topology_check_fallback: true` if the §5 fallback fired; + the wave
   grouping table for `DAG`).
5. `## Candidates` — one block per candidate: `draft_id`, `task_id` (or
   `(dry-run)`), `title`, `description`, `acceptance_criteria`, rationale
   linking back to the success criteria it covers.
6. `## Dependency Edges` — table of (from_task_id, to_task_id, reason).
7. `## Cost Breakdown` — orchestrator + per-subagent cost rows + TOTAL.

Set `generated_at`-paired end time immediately before the final write.

## Cost budget (Guardrail-adjacent — LIVE rule)

Track running cost across the orchestrator + every subagent dispatch
(cache-discounted USD, same formula as `LOOP-RUN.md` §4.4). After each
subagent returns, read its `usage` block and increment an in-memory
counter — that counter is the source of truth for both thresholds. **If a
subagent returns no `usage` block** (some agent types omit it), estimate its
cost from its tool-call count and output size, add the estimate to the
counter, and mark the artifact's `total_usd` approximate (prefix `~`) so a
reader knows the cap was enforced against an estimate.

Amounts below are written without a leading `$`-then-digit on purpose: a
bare `$` immediately followed by a digit in a skill body is captured by
argument substitution at load time (read as a positional arg) and renders
corrupted — write the USD figure instead.

- **5 USD soft target** — when running cost crosses **5 USD**, emit a
  checkpoint to stdout and record `checkpoint_5usd_at_step: <step>` (optional
  frontmatter field). The run **continues**.
- **15 USD hard cap** — when running cost crosses **15 USD**, **HALT
  immediately**. Preserve all work completed up to that step (materialized
  tasks stay; do NOT roll back), write a partial `DECOMPOSITION.md` with
  `cost_cap_hit: true`, and report the halt to the user. The user re-runs
  with `--resume <decomposition_id>` (idempotent on `decomposition_id`) to
  continue from the last completed step.

## Guardrails (LIVE rules — do NOT remove)

Each guardrail is enforced by a falsifiable test gate in
[`src/api/routes/tasks/__tests__/skill-decompose-design.test.ts`](../../src/api/routes/tasks/__tests__/skill-decompose-design.test.ts)
and the sibling fixtures test. Do not weaken those tests without
simultaneously updating `docs/tasks-decompose-design.md` §5.

1. **MUST NOT execute the decomposed tasks** (plan/execute separation). The
   skill does NOT call `claim_task`, `update_task` status transitions, or
   dispatch worker subagents that mutate the source tree beyond the Step-2
   read-only recon. Materialization (`create_task` / `add_dependency`) is
   creation only — never execution. `/tasks:loop` and `/tasks:loop-dag` are
   the executor halves; keep them separate.
2. **MUST NOT modify itself** (no self-rewrite). Refuse any `Edit` /
   `Write` / `MultiEdit` against `skills/tasks/decompose.md`,
   `docs/tasks-decompose-design.md`, and `src/lib/decompose/**`. A
   self-modifying skill cannot be audited statically — the moment the skill
   file is mutable from inside the run, guardrails 1, 3, and 4 stop being
   load-bearing.
3. **MUST halt + ask the user if Step 4 rejects ≥ 30% of candidate pairs**
   as inter-dependent (`interdependent_ratio ≥ 0.30`). Write
   `aborted_reason: high_interdependence` and stop before Step 5.
4. **MUST refuse goals containing `deploy`, `migrate production`, or
   `delete data`** (whole-word, case-insensitive `\b(...)\b`). The refusal
   fires in Step 1 input validation, **before any subagent dispatch**.
