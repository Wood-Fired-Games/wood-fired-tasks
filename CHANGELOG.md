## [v1.17] - 2026-06-04

A **reliability + process-hardening** release in two halves, with no change to
the public API/MCP/CLI/migration surface (still 27 MCP tools and 15 migrations).

**1. New-user first-run reliability.** A new-user first-run audit + remediation
pass: every gap that could break a fresh-clone or fresh-install experience was
fixed, the Quick Start was made to work verbatim from a clean checkout, and
guards were added so the documented first-run path can't silently drift again.

**2. Loop / decompose process-hardening.** The `/tasks:loop`, `/tasks:loop-dag`,
and `/tasks:decompose` skills gained structural guards — derived from the
[2026-06-01 WSJF remote-MCP-parity retrospective](docs/retrospectives/2026-06-01-wsjf-remote-parity-planning-gap.md)
— that stop the "every task PASSed but the feature is unreachable in production"
failure class: planning now carries a surface-coverage matrix, decompose
auto-emits remote-parity coverage tasks, and the loops refuse to declare a clean
"drained → done" until an end-to-end reachability + parity audit is green.

### Fixed
- **`DATABASE_PATH` now honored when starting the API server** (#703). Starting
  the server (`npm start`) previously ignored `DATABASE_PATH` and opened the
  default DB, so a new user who set it saw their data land in the wrong file.
  The start path now resolves `DATABASE_PATH` consistently with the rest of the
  toolchain.
- **`npm run migrate` honors `DATABASE_PATH`** (#704), defaulting to
  `./data/tasks.db` when unset — so migrations and the running server now agree
  on which database file is in use. (#705) adds end-to-end regression coverage
  asserting the config path is honored across migrate + server start.
- **Expected-error test log noise downgraded** (#709). Routes that deliberately
  exercise client-error (4xx) paths in tests no longer emit error-level logs for
  those expected outcomes; genuine 5xx server errors still log at error level.
- **PAT `touchLastUsed` guarded against a shutdown race** (#710). Last-used
  bookkeeping on personal access tokens no longer attempts to write to an
  already-closed database during server shutdown, removing a spurious error on
  exit.
- **Decompose WSJF schema-drift dogfood finding** (#712). The live `create_task`
  MCP tool input (`CreateTaskClientSchema.extend({ wsjf_submission, wsjf_trigger })`)
  exposes *two* WSJF paths — the classified, gate-enforced `wsjf_submission` +
  `wsjf_trigger` envelope, and a raw pre-computed `wsjf` object (`WsjfWriteSchema`,
  the manual-override path). `skills/tasks/decompose.md` documented only the
  former, so an agent inspecting the raw schema could mistake the bare `wsjf`
  object for the decompose contract and bypass the column-anchored batch gate.
  Clarified the skill with an explicit "use `wsjf_submission`, NOT the raw `wsjf`
  object" callout disambiguating the two paths. Runtime behavior unchanged — the
  tool schema and scoring flow were already correct; only the skill text drifted.
  Added a `create_task` opt-out test asserting that omitting `wsjf_submission`
  materializes an unscored task (no history row, null components).
- **`docs/CLI.md` `--json` output paths corrected** (#716). The documented JSON
  paths for `--json` command output had drifted (e.g. `.data.id`); the examples
  now match the actual emitted shape.

### Added
- **Decompose surface-coverage matrix + invariant-rider** (#649). New
  `docs/superpowers/PLAN-TEMPLATE.md` plan/spec template carries a
  **surface-coverage matrix** — every capability is mapped across the 8 canonical
  deployment surfaces (`stdio MCP, remote MCP, REST, CLI, skills, client-package
  mirror, docs/tool-count, migration/backfill`), and every non-N/A cell must
  yield a task. `/tasks:decompose` gained a Step 8c **invariant-rider** pass that
  detects which surfaces a change touches and auto-emits the paired coverage
  tasks / AC riders (e.g. a new stdio MCP tool auto-emits a remote-proxy parity
  task) so a surface missing from the plan can't silently drop through
  decomposition. Documented in `docs/tasks-decompose-design.md`; gated by content
  tests.
- **Loop terminal completeness gate** (#650). `/tasks:loop` and `/tasks:loop-dag`
  no longer treat "0 open tasks" as sufficient to declare a backlog drained.
  Before exit they run a terminal **invariant + reachability audit** (loop-shared
  `§O`): the structural `stdio ⊆ remote` MCP parity test plus a reachability
  smoke that exercises newly-added MCP tools through the **real remote proxy
  path** (`dist/mcp/remote`), not in-process. On a detected gap the loop
  materializes a remediation task (an explicit, documented carve-out to the
  "don't create tasks during the loop" rule) and surfaces it in a new
  `## Coverage Gaps` LOOP-RUN.md section instead of declaring success.
- **Fresh-clone smoke recipe** (#708). `npm run smoke` boots a temporary server
  against an isolated `DATABASE_PATH`, runs the documented Quick Start flow
  (migrate → build → start → create project → create task → list) end-to-end,
  and tears the temp DB down — a one-command check that the new-user path works.
- **README Quick Start drift guard** (#713). A vitest spec
  (`src/__tests__/readme-quickstart-drift.test.ts`, runs in `npm test`) asserts
  the README Quick Start keeps using the in-tree `npm run cli --` invocation and
  never reintroduces a broken first-run pattern (e.g. a bare global `tasks`
  command or an assumed project id 1).
- **Codex CLI user-level MCP setup docs** (#711). `docs/MCP.md` now documents
  registering the server with `codex mcp add … -- ~/.local/bin/wft-mcp`,
  including that Codex stores the entry user-level and the launcher resolves the
  API key at spawn time.

### Changed
- **README Quick Start rewritten to work from a fresh clone** (#706). The Quick
  Start now runs entirely via `npm run cli -- <args>` with no `npm link` / no
  global `tasks` binary required, sets `DATABASE_PATH`, clarifies the separate
  `API_KEYS` (server) vs `API_KEY` (client) vars, and explicitly tells users to
  create a project and use the returned id rather than assuming id 1.
- **SETUP.md and CLI.md aligned with the fixed Quick Start** (#707). The CLI
  reference now frames every `tasks <command>` example as a documented alias for
  `npm run cli -- <command>`, with `npm link` called out as optional.
- **README CLI Summary notes the `tasks-cmd` alias** (#718). The CLI summary now
  records that `tasks-cmd` is an alias for the in-tree `npm run cli` invocation.

### Internal

- Test discovery excludes `.claude/worktrees/` so isolated-worktree subagent
  checkouts don't balloon or hang `npm test` (#717); removed a duplicated comment
  block in `src/api/start.ts` (#719). No runtime behavior change.

## [v1.16] - 2026-06-03

Ships **WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First) economic prioritization**. Every task can be scored on its Cost of Delay (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk/Opportunity-Enablement) divided by Job Size, so `/tasks:loop` and `/tasks:loop-dag` drain work by economic value rather than a hand-set `priority` enum. Scores are computed autonomously at task-creation time against a per-project **value charter**, every score carries a verbatim evidence trail plus append-only history, and a non-blocking degeneracy linter catches the classic WSJF anti-patterns. Fully backward-compatible: projects with no charter and no scores sort by `priority` then age exactly as before.

### Added
- **4 new WSJF MCP tools, with full stdio↔remote parity** (identical names, descriptions, and input schemas):
  - `wsjf_ranking` — rank a project's tasks by propagation-adjusted WSJF; `scope="frontier"` (default) excludes blocked/not-ready tasks, `scope="all"` ranks every task; returns the ordered list with components, base vs effective WSJF, and the downstream Cost-of-Delay `propagation` breakdown.
  - `wsjf_history` — a task's append-only WSJF score-history timeline (oldest-first), each entry annotated with a `deltas` map of per-component from→to changes vs the previous entry.
  - `rescore_project` *(mutation)* — deterministically rescore a project's already-scored tasks against the current value charter; opens a rescore run, writes one history row per changed task, skips locked components, returns evaluated/changed/skipped-locked counts.
  - `wsjf_health` — lint a project's WSJF state for degeneracies/pitfalls (non-blocking): near-identical scores, missing CoD `1` anchor, collapsed Job Size, past-deadline stale Time Criticality, high priority-fallback ratio, and score-churn. Empty findings ⇔ healthy.
  - Registered on both transports — stdio (`src/mcp/tools/wsjf-tools.ts`, wired in `src/mcp/server.ts`) and remote proxy (`src/mcp/remote/register-tools.ts`). MCP tool count rises from 23 to **27** on both transports. See [`docs/MCP.md`](docs/MCP.md).
- **New REST endpoints** (base scope `/api/v1`). See [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md).
  - Task-scoped (`src/api/routes/tasks/wsjf.ts`): `GET /tasks/:id/wsjf` (read the four WSJF components + locks), `PUT /tasks/:id/wsjf` (manual-override set/lock of the four components; runs the enum + cross-component contradiction gate and writes a `manual` score-history row), `GET /tasks/:id/score-history` (append-only timeline with actor/charter/rescore-run provenance; backs `wsjf_history`).
  - Project-scoped (`src/api/routes/projects/wsjf.ts`): `GET /projects/:id/charter-history`, `GET /projects/:id/rescore-runs`, `GET /projects/:id/wsjf-ranking` (backs `wsjf_ranking`), `GET /projects/:id/wsjf-health` (backs `wsjf_health`), `POST /projects/:id/rescore` *(mutation, backs `rescore_project`)*.
- **New CLI commands** (`src/cli/commands/wsjf.ts`), all read commands emitting bare JSON:
  - `tasks wsjf-history <id>` — a task's append-only WSJF score history (oldest-first).
  - `tasks wsjf-set <id> --value <fib> --time-criticality <fib> --risk-opportunity <fib> --job-size <fib> [--lock <keys>]` — manual set/lock of a task's four components; all four flags required, each a Fibonacci tier (1,2,3,5,8,13); `--lock` takes comma-separated keys from `value,timeCriticality,riskOpportunity,jobSize`; runs the same enum + contradiction gate as REST/MCP.
  - `tasks charter-history <id>` — a project's value-charter history (oldest-first). See [`docs/CLI.md`](docs/CLI.md).
- **Migrations 013/014/015** (`src/db/migrations/`), bringing the migration count from 12 to **15**:
  - `013-wsjf-fields.ts` — adds the four nullable Fibonacci-CHECK component columns (`wsjf_value`, `wsjf_time_criticality`, `wsjf_risk_opportunity`, `wsjf_job_size`) plus five JSON metadata columns (`wsjf_evidence`, `wsjf_locked`, `wsjf_source`, `wsjf_classifications`, `wsjf_features`) on `tasks`. An all-four-or-none invariant is enforced at the Zod write boundary, not by a SQLite constraint.
  - `014-value-charter.ts` — adds the nullable JSON `value_charter` column on `projects`.
  - `015-wsjf-audit.ts` — adds three append-only audit tables: `wsjf_rescore_run`, `wsjf_score_history` (one immutable row per score write, storing classifications + features for LLM-free replay), and `project_charter_history`.
- **`value_charter` on projects + per-project setup interview.** The `/tasks:new-project` skill runs a STOP-and-wait, one-question-at-a-time interview capturing the project's value charter (mission, 2–4 Fibonacci-weighted value themes, time context, risk posture, out-of-scope). Skipping is valid — no charter is written and scoring falls back to the `priority` enum. The charter is the reference frame for User-Business-Value scoring.
- **Autonomous evidence-backed WSJF scoring at decompose/create.** `/tasks:decompose` (Step 8a) batch-scores the whole candidate set one Cost-of-Delay column at a time against the charter, anchoring the lowest candidate per column to the `1` tier. The LLM never emits a number: it submits classifications over closed enums (`theme + alignment`, `severity`, `decay`, a server-banded `jobSizeTier`) plus a verbatim evidence span per component, and the server (`validateScoreSubmission` in `src/services/wsjf.service.ts`) recomputes the four Fibonacci components deterministically and rejects degenerate batches (no `1` anchor, sub-floor variance).
- **`/tasks:loop` and `/tasks:loop-dag` select work by effective WSJF.** When a project has ≥ 1 scored task, the priority+ID sort is replaced by `wsjf_ranking` order (descending `effectiveWsjf`, unscored tasks slotted via a `priorityFallbackScore` map). Ranking gates on the ready frontier and propagates downstream Cost of Delay onto blockers (`effective_CoD = base_CoD + Σ dependents' base_CoD · γ^(dist−1)`, γ=0.5, capped at 3×), so a boring prerequisite that unblocks a large high-value subtree rises to the top. The ranking snapshot is written into `LOOP-RUN.md` for reproducibility, and `wsjf_health` is surfaced at loop start.

## [v1.15] - 2026-05-31

Makes the `wft-router` automation daemon actually reachable by npm users. It was advertised as a shipped feature since v1.13 but was a separate, never-published package (`@wood-fired-games/wft-router`), so it reached nobody via npm. It now ships **inside** the `wood-fired-tasks` package.

### Added
- **`wft-router` now ships in the `wood-fired-tasks` package.** Its built output and a `wft-router` bin are bundled into the published tarball; run it with `wft-router` / `npx wft-router` after install. The standalone `@wood-fired-games/wft-router` package is dropped (marked private). `pino` and `yaml` are now core runtime dependencies.

### Fixed
- **`wft-router` bin was a silent no-op when installed.** Its entry-point guard compared `import.meta.url` (symlink-resolved real path) against `process.argv[1]` (the `node_modules/.bin/wft-router` symlink path), which never matched, so `main()` never ran. The guard now resolves `argv[1]` to its real path. Regression-tested via `isEntryPoint`.

## [v1.14] - 2026-05-31

Ships loop-evidence anti-fabrication guardrails for `/tasks:loop` and `/tasks:loop-dag`. (First npm release since 1.12.0 — the 1.13.0 changeset was tagged `v1.13` but never published to npm, so this release also delivers everything under `[v1.13]` below.)

### Added
- **Loop evidence anti-fabrication guardrails** (#608): defense-in-depth against `/tasks:loop[-dag]` agents closing tasks on fabricated evidence. (1) Opt-in server gate `WFT_STRICT_EVIDENCE` (**default off**) — `update_task` rejects `verification_evidence` whose `verifier_session_id` is empty, equals the task assignee or the calling identity, or matches a self-grading pattern (`^orchestrator`/`^self`/`^main-loop`), and rejects placeholder/empty check evidence text (`src/services/evidence-validation.ts`). (2) Optional client-side `PreToolUse` reference hook `docs/hooks/validate-sha.mjs` that blocks evidence citing git SHAs unknown to the local repo. (3) Anti-fabrication / one-state-mutation-per-turn / separate-verifier discipline in the loop skills. Full rationale and honest scope in [`docs/RELIABILITY.md`](docs/RELIABILITY.md).

### Security
- Closes a trust gap where an orchestrating agent could self-grade `verification_evidence` (writing `verifier_session_id="orchestrator-…"` instead of dispatching a separate verifier) or cite nonexistent commit SHAs, leaving a live regression behind a `PASS`. Pieces A + B make these structural fabrications deterministically blockable when enabled; numeric truthfulness remains discipline-governed (not machine-enforceable) — stated explicitly in `docs/RELIABILITY.md`.

## [v1.13] - 2026-05-31

Ships the `wft-router` event-driven automation daemon, a `wait_for_unblock` MCP long-poll tool, and a `qs` DoS fix.

### Added
- **`wft-router` automation daemon** (`packages/wft-router`): a vendor-neutral service that subscribes to task lifecycle events over SSE and dispatches configured handlers. Includes a `triggers.yaml` Zod schema with a `--validate` flag, a predicate evaluator with templating, an idempotency store + dispatch state machine, a fetch-based SSE client with resume + watchdog, rate-limit/debounce/graceful-shutdown primitives, a pino logger, a cross-platform default path resolver, and a Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint (loopback by default).
- **`wft-router` handlers**: `create_task_in_project`, `webhook_post` (TLS posture guard), `shell_exec` (env scrubbing), and `agent_session_dispatch` (adapter extension), all on a shared handler contract.
- **`wait_for_unblock` MCP tool**: a long-poll tool to await dependency unblocking, available locally and SSE-backed on the remote server.
- `events.subscribeOnce` helper with deterministic teardown.
- **`wft-router` packaging**: OCI `Containerfile` + multi-arch `oci-build` CI job, host-platform manifests (systemd, launchd, Windows), reference adapters, deploy assets, and an example config.
- npm publish wiring: `prepublishOnly` gate (build + test + lint:deps + audit + pack-check) and a `pack-smoke` CI job.

### Changed
- README now leads with the AI-orchestration framing.
- `wft-router` assignee where-predicate to scope unblock dispatches.
- Stryker mutation CI re-sharded (api/mcp split, 7-way by mutant count).

### Fixed
- `wft-router` SSE client yields events incrementally instead of buffering until close, and applies an idle/read timeout so half-open sockets reconnect.
- `deploy/upgrade.sh` smoke test no longer hangs on a sudo TTY prompt.
- CI host-manifests systemd verify step no longer aborts under `errexit`.

### Security
- Forced `qs >= 6.15.2` to close GHSA-q8mj-m7cp-5q26 (prototype-pollution DoS).
- `wft-router` owner-uid hardening on adapter directory resolution; the `http://` posture guard is documented as a literal-host-only SSRF boundary.
- `wft-router` vendor-neutrality CI gate + denylist.
- `wft-router` pino logger redacts secret key-names and filesystem paths.

## [v1.12] - 2026-05-25

First public open-source release. OSS-launch readiness and CI sharding work landed since v1.11.

### Added
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` operator recovery runbook (boot failures, wrong/stale DB, safe backup/restore); linked from AGENTS.md, README, and the docs index (task 355).
- Tool-count drift regression test for public docs (task 260).
- `.env.example` aligned with documented config (task 259).

### Changed
- License relicensed from ISC to MIT for OSS launch (task 253).
- SECURITY.md rewritten for the actual TypeScript/Fastify stack (task 254).
- OSS package metadata + npm `files` allowlist (task 255).
- Installer split into local vs. remote MCP paths; `--api-key` flag deprecated (still parsed and honored, emits a deprecation warning — prefer `WOOD_FIRED_TASKS_API_KEY`, the per-user secret file, or the interactive prompt) (task 258).
- Stryker mutation tests sharded across 4 parallel CI jobs; threshold raised to 75; workflow timeout extended (tasks 250, 252).
- Shipped systemd unit (`deploy/wood-fired-tasks.service`) now orders after `network-online.target` so OIDC discovery doesn't crash-loop the service on a cold boot; `StartLimitBurst` raised to 5 (task 353).
- `docs/MCP.md` now recommends the remote (REST) variant as the single-writer default, warns that the local direct-SQLite variant silently serves stale data, and documents a launcher-wrapper that keeps the API key out of client config (task 356).

### Fixed
- Test runs cleanly clean up `task.status_changed` listeners between runs (task 257).

## [v1.11] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- `completion_report` tool on the remote MCP server (task 245).

### Changed
- List endpoints documented with paginated envelope shape (task 248).
- CLI `TaskResponse` derived from the server Zod schema instead of being hand-maintained (task 246).
- CLI shell-completions command list derived from the Commander registry (task 247).

### Fixed
- Dropped duplicate `metadata.range` field in `tasks completed --json` output.

## [v1.9] - 2026-05-20

- `GET /api/v1/events` SSE endpoint, `SSEManager` with buffering.
- Atomic claim protocol (CAS + `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`), `claim_task` MCP tool,
  `tasks claim` CLI, stale-claim auto-release service (phase 15).
- `WorkflowEngine` parent auto-complete with cascade depth + dependency
  auto-unblock (phase 16).

### Changed

  (phase 12).
- `README.md`, `docs/SETUP.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/CLI.md`, `docs/MCP.md`.
- E2E regression suite and skill-file validation tests.

### Fixed

### Added
- Project, dependency, comment, subtask, and health CLI commands
  (phases 08-01 through 08-05).
- MCP project tools, `list_subtasks` task tool, and `check_health` health
  tool (phase 09).
- Global `--json`, `--no-input`, `--force` flags and `@clack/prompts`
  interactive prompts (phase 07).
- `NO_COLOR` environment variable support.

### Fixed
- HTTP client only sends `Content-Type` when the request has a body.
- `dotenv` stdout contamination suppressed so JSON output stays clean.
